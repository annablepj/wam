# Workroom Accounting Manager

A reasonably simple system for jobs, customers, billing and inventory tracking for a workroom.

## Development Setup

This assumes you have Git already installed along with ssh keys and PAT token.
Also recommend you install miniconda and setup a virtual enviornment, using Python 3.9

```txt

pip install django
# confirm installation
python -m django --version

git clone git@github.com:annablepj/wam
```
